# NLP_preprocessing_techniques
In this repository i will collect various techniques in NLP preprocessing with the purpose to fully understand available techniques along with their pro's and cons.
In many new libraries and modules preprocessing can be done with just line of code. 
I want to learn to do these proprocessing with the granular lines of code in order to fully understand what is happening under the hood.
